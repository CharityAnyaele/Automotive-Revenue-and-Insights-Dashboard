# Automotive-Revenue-and-Insights-Dashboard
This is an end-to-end data analysis project covering data cleaning, transformation, modelling, and dashboard creation using power bi
This project presents an interactive Automotive Revenue & Insights Dashboard built entirely in Power BI. The report analyzes total revenue, annual purchase trends, customer demographics, and brand performance across key automotive manufacturers.

All data preparation—including data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization—was completed inside Power BI using Power Query and DAX.

The dashboard delivers insights into yearly purchases, gender distribution, age group segmentation, monthly performance, and vehicle model preferences. It is designed to support decision-making across sales, marketing, and strategic planning teams.
